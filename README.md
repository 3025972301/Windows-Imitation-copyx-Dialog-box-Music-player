# Windows-Imitation-copyx-Dialog-box-Music-player
This is an imitation music player written by EPL(Easy Programming Language).
It basically mimics the dialog box that pops up when file operations are performed in Windows 8.
The program uses bass as the cornerstone of the player, and the program does not have any paid content.
The source code contains a lot of open source code from the bbs.125.la website, thanks to the open source authors; I can't show whose source code is used here, because the program uses so much that it can be said that the program is stitched together.
I am learning a language related to C, and maybe there will be this program written by C in the future.
